It has gained popularity due to its potential for creating decentralized, trustless, and tamper-proof systems. A blockchain hackathon would provide a platform for developers, entrepreneurs, and blockchain enthusiasts to collaborate, share knowledge, and build innovative blockchain-based solutions. Participants in a blockchain hackathon would be expected to have knowledge of blockchain technology, its workings, and its potential applications. They would also need to have programming skills and knowledge of software development. The hackathon could have a specific focus, such as developing a decentralized application for supply chain management or creating a blockchain-based identity verification system. The hackathon could be organized over a period of a few days or even weeks, allowing participants to ideate, collaborate, and develop their solutions. Participants could form teams, pitch their ideas, and receive mentorship and feedback from industry experts. The hackathon could culminate in a demo day, where participants showcase their solutions to a panel of judges and potential investors."
